# ChatGPT Generated Programs

### 1. Using the programming language PROCESSING, write a program to draw a psychedelic fractal zoom

File: [pyschedelic_fractal.pde](https://github.com/kennycason/chatgpt_code/blob/main/psychedelic_fractal.pde)

Output: 
> Here is a simple implementation of a psychedelic fractal zoom in the programming language Processing:
> This code generates a psychedelic fractal zoom by drawing a series of lines with random colors at each iteration. The zoom level is gradually increased over time, resulting in a constantly changing and mesmerizing visual effect.

Worked after moving `size(500, 500);` into the `setup()` function.

### 2. Write python code to control dc motor with L298N Motor Driver Controller with reverse and forward

File: [dc_motor_with_l298n.py](https://github.com/kennycason/chatgpt_code/blob/main/dc_motor_with_l298n.py)

I was quite surprised as to the breadth of ChatGPT with this one. 
It was able to generate a working Python code to control two DC motors via the L298N Motor Driver Controller with reverse and forward.
The generated code had a minor bug that prevented reverse from working, otherwise it worked out-of-the-box. 
I tested it on a robotic tank I have been working on.



### 3. Using the programming language PROCESSING (java mode), write john conway's game of life and then simplify the code and remove code comments

Worked after minor edits and asking ChatGPT to write specific functions separately due to the length of the program. 
This surprisingly worked quite well, and I only needed reference ChatGPT in order to write this program. 
Additionally, this is my first project to use Processing.

### 4. Write python code for blackjack game

File: [blackjack.py](https://github.com/kennycason/chatgpt_code/blob/main/blackjack.py)

I finished the final lines of code myself due to ChatGPT output buffer max length.

```shell
Your hand:
10 of Hearts
3 of Spades
Dealer's hand:
10 of Diamonds
Your hand:
10 of Hearts
3 of Spades
10 of Clubs
You busted! Dealer wins.
```
```shell
Your hand:
5 of Spades
1 of Diamonds
Dealer's hand:
10 of Clubs
Your hand:
5 of Spades
1 of Diamonds
2 of Spades
Your hand:
5 of Spades
1 of Diamonds
2 of Spades
1 of Hearts
Your hand:
5 of Spades
1 of Diamonds
2 of Spades
1 of Hearts
10 of Clubs
You win!
```

File: [blackjack2.py](https://github.com/kennycason/chatgpt_code/blob/main/blackjack2.py)

Worked as-is

```shell
Your hand:
7 of Hearts
10 of Clubs
Dealer's hand:
2 of Clubs
Dealer's hand:
2 of Clubs
7 of Spades
10 of Hearts
You Lose!
```



### 5. Using the programming language PROCESSING (java mode), write a program to draw a psychedelic pattern

File: [pyschedelic_pattern.pde](https://github.com/kennycason/chatgpt_code/blob/main/pyschedelic_pattern.pde)

Worked after minor editing.
