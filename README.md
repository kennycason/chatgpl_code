### Using the programming language PROCESSING, write a program to draw a psychedelic fractal zoom

File: [pyschedelic_fractal.pde](https://github.com/kennycason/chatgpt_code/blob/main/psychedelic_fractal.pde)

[Video](https://v.usetapes.com/tN8SdeBlYD)

Output: 
> Here is a simple implementation of a psychedelic fractal zoom in the programming language Processing:
> This code generates a psychedelic fractal zoom by drawing a series of lines with random colors at each iteration. The zoom level is gradually increased over time, resulting in a constantly changing and mesmerizing visual effect.

Result: üëç

Notes: I had to move `size(500, 500);` into the `setup()` function.
