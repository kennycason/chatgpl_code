# write a neural network that learns patterns of vectors that can fill in missing features of an input another vector
# python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"
# python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.reduce_sum(tf.random.normal([1000, 1000])))"

# Initial code resulted in errors, I then asked ChatGPT to fix the errors:
# This error occurs because the input to the neural network is not a 2D array with a specified number of rows and columns, as expected by the Dense layer. In the provided code, the input vector is defined as a 1D array, which is not compatible with the Dense layer.
#
# To fix this error, you can reshape the input vector to a 2D array with a single row and the same number of columns as the input vector. This can be done using the numpy.reshape() function, as shown in the following example:
#
# It then generated the below error, which I asked to fix:
# ValueError: Data cardinality is ambiguous:
#   x sizes: 1
#   y sizes: 7
# Make sure all arrays contain the same number of samples.


# Here is a simple example of a neural network that learns patterns of vectors that can fill in missing features of an input vector in the Python programming language using the Keras library:
import numpy as np
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.models import Sequential

# Define the input vector
input_vector = np.array([1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 5, 0])

# Reshape the input vector to a 2D array with a single row
input_vector = input_vector.reshape(1, -1)

# Define the target vector
target_vector = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6])

# Reshape the target vector to a 2D array with a single row
target_vector = target_vector.reshape(1, -1)

# Create the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(7, input_dim=7, activation='relu')) # changed from 8 to 7 for param0
model.add(Dense(7, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(7, activation='linear'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='adam')

# Fit the model on the input and target vectors
model.fit(input_vector, target_vector, epochs=500, verbose=0)

# Make a prediction on the input vector
prediction = model.predict(input_vector)

# Print the prediction
print(prediction)
# Input: [1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 5, 0]
# Output: [[1.0007035 1.9939888 2.890111  4.0253167 4.0233617 5.0451546 5.9479346]]

# My addition for more tests
# Test partial vectors
print(model.predict( np.array([1, 2, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0]).reshape(1, -1)))
print(model.predict( np.array([1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]).reshape(1, -1)))
